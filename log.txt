>>>DESIGN DECISIONS AND RATIONALE

- Decision: The overview of recipes should be scrollable.
- Rationale: Compared to page view, you can see more recipes in a shorter amount of time when scrolling.This is because in page view you have to press the button a lot of times to get to the bottom of the list.


- Decision: We should be able to adjust the serving size with a drop down menu and serving size should be limited 1-7.
- Rationale: We wanted to make sure invalid data is not added to the serving size field. This could create errors in the processing code. Since our app is a weekly planner for a student, we are assuming that they will not need to make a meal more than 7 times in a week. At the max serving size (7) they can eat the meal once a day for the whole week.


- Decision: abbreviate the measurement units when showing the ingredients
- Rationale: we did this because some of the measurement units (like millimeters) took up a lot of space and it didn't look nice. Also, most people are used to seeing the abbreviated version (tsp, tbsp, cm, m).


- Decision: Make the timer at the top right and limit it to 23:59:59.
- Rationale: the top right position seemed the most suitable for the timer counter for the current GUI made, it is easy to notice it and it is small enough not to distract while cooking as well as big enough to see it without needing to keep the phone close. Also the limit of 23:59:59 was chosen because it is unrealistic that the user would cook something beyond 24-hour-mark and the limit is enough for the user to cook some very time-consuming recipes and still be able to use our app.

- Decision: Reset and stop buttons.
- Rationale: Reset and stop buttons felt essential for the cooking timer to account for the situation when the user needs to leave the kitchen for some reason, but would still continue cooking after and wants to save the progress of the cooking - therefore the stop button. The reset button was implemented for situations when say the user pressed start on the timer accidentally and wants to reset or when the user just wants to start over.

- Decision: Ratings are 1 to 5 rather than some arbitrary words.
- Rationale: the rating was changed from some arbitrary words like “delicious” for taste and “easy” for difficulty to just a number from 1 to 5. This was done because it is much more to understand what the rating actually is for both the user and the dev, it is much easier to process the integers rather than strings for rating, and much easier to calculate the overall rating of the recipe, which is now just an average of taste and quality ratings. Simplicity won here.

- Decision: Disable the finish button in reading recipe activity
- Rationale: The finish button is disabled and the user cannot press it until the timer is started and stopped, if the user resets the timer the button will become disabled again. This was done so that the user cannot proceed to rate recipe activity and cannot store 00:00:00 for the time of the recipe until the user actually start and finishes cooking the recipe

- Decision: Disable the meal plans button
- Rationale: The meal plans button on the bottom navigation menu was disabled because that feature is planned for iteration 3 and is not accessible for the users for now.

- Decision: Warning message when restart is pressed.
- Rationale: When restart is pressed, a pop up warning message will come up to make sure the user does not press restart unintentionally and ruins his timer progress on the recipe.

- Decision: Add Recipe view only for adding recipes
- Rationale: When initially creating the view it showed that the page was quickly becoming too cluttered with the add ingredient, add instructions and add recipe buttons and boxes. So to make it easier for the user to use and not so cluttered we created a separate activity that opens where the user can add ingredients and/or instructions to that recipe only. And go back to the add recipe page only to add a new recipe.

- Decision: Making the add instruction text windows a lot bigger
- Rationale: When trying to add a lot of text it quickly fills just a normal text box, so in order for the user to be able to see everything they are typing before they submit it we made the windows a lot bigger than regular to see multiple lines of written text.

- Decision: Adding duplicate recipe check with continue or cancel alert
- Rationale: Before we would not allow duplicates into the recipe list but there might be a time when there could be different recipes for the same thing so we added a dialog box to warn the user there is a duplicate and they can choose whether to continue adding or cancel.
