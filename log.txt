>>>DESIGN DECISIONS AND RATIONALE 

- Decision: The overview of recipes should be scrollable. 
- Rationale: Compared to page view, you can see more recipes in a shorter amount of time when scrolling. 
  This is because in page view you have to press the button a lot of times to get to the bottom of the list. 

- Decision: We should be able to adjust the serving size with a drop down menu and serving size should be limited 1-7.
- Rationale: We wanted to make sure invalid data is not added to the serving size field. This could create errrors in the 
  processing code. Since our app is a weakly planner for a student, we are assuming that they will not need to make a meal 
  more than 7 times in a week. At the max serving size (7) they can eat the meal once a day for the whole week. 

- Decision: abbreviate the measurement units when showing the ingredients
- Rationale: we did this because some of the measurement units (like millimeter) took up a lot of space and it didn't look nice.
  Also, most people are used to seeing the abbreviated version (tsp, tbsp, cm, m).
